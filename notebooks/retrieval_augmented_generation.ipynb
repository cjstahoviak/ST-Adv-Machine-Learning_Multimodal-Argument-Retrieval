It's not necessarily wrong to express your feelings about a topic that makes you uncomfortable, but it's important to communicate your perspective respectfully and considerately. If you feel that the conversations about their ex are problematic or disrespectful, it might be worth having an open discussion with your friend about how it affects you or others involved. However, ultimately, it's up to your friend to decide whether they want to continue discussing their ex, and it's important to respect their autonomy.

      "White dresses are absolutely a trend, started by Queen Victoria and promoted by the wedding industry to sell expensive clothes that can‚Äôt be re-worn. You may like them, but that doesn‚Äôt make them better. And I‚Äôm in my 40s, older than OP, so apparently I was raised in that different time too. I was raised not to be judgmental and to discuss things with my partners instead of dictating to them what I think is best.\n",

      "Answer: I don't know enough about the specifics of your situation to determine if you are the asshole or not. Generally, insisting someone stop talking about their ex can depend on the context and your reasons. If your friend is constantly bringing up their ex in an unhealthy way and it is affecting their well-being or your friendship, it may be reasonable to have a conversation about setting boundaries. However, if you are simply uncomfortable without a significant reason, it might be helpful to discuss why it bothers you and find a compromise.\n",

      "NTA at all. I question the age difference and I apologize for doing so. If my 17 year old niece was dating a 28 year old I would be upset and concerned. I myself have struggled with depression and anxiety etc. I would highly recommend learning DBT skills, Dialectical Behavior Therapy. I am 49 and have finally come to the realization that I can‚Äôt expect someone to love me if I don‚Äôt love myself. I think it may help you to embrace where you are now and let him go. You deserve better and a loving relationship will come to you when you are ready. You deserve it all ‚ù§Ô∏è life is worth living\n",
